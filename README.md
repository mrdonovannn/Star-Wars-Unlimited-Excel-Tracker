# Star-Wars-Unlimited-Excel-Tracker
A very simple html file to parse through CSVs and generate a ttable that can be copied and pasted into Excel.

This tool uses the CSV files found here: https://tcgcsv.com/.

Simply put these files all into the same directory and run input.html. A remarkably simple form is all you need to generate the Files. Upload the files from TCGCSV, select the set you want to pull the cards from, and generate the cards!

The included spreadsheet is likely how I will be formatting my collection tracker, I'll have 2 sheets per set - one to track what cards I have in my collection binder and cards that I want to keep, and the other sheet to track all of my extra duplicate cards and bulk that I wouldn't mind getting rid of. Unfortunately, I decided against adding the pricing data, purely because that would just require me to update my sheet more frequently than I would care to, so everything is purely for tracking counts.
